# Seth C Bennett
## Current
I am a Graduate Student at Northwest Missouri State University with a BS in Computer Science and I am currently obtaining my Master's in Applied Computer Science. Furthermore, I will be working as a Graduate Assistant in the Spring of 2022 for Dr. Aziz Fellah in his Computer Organization class.

## Background
I am from a small rural town in Northwest Missouri named Albany. My hobbies are large in number and a few of them are as follows:
- Playing/Writing music(guitar, piano, ukelelle)
- Playing games
- Solving puzzles(like rubiks cubes)
- Watching various streaming services
- Enjoying the outdoors
- Hanging out with Friends/Family

## Plans
My current career plans are to continue with my master's degree and as planned graduate in December of 2022. On the way to this goal, I hope to pursue an internship in Software Development so that I may obtain a job in the same or a similar position after graduation.
